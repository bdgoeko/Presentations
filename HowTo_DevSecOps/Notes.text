Abstrct:

DevSecOps is an evolution of computing.  During this persentation will discuss how DevSecOps came about and why.  And then discuss some Tenants of doing good DevSecOps!

I will talk about DevSecOps, starting with a brief history of how we got to DevSecOps to help explain where we are and why we are here.  Then we will dive into the Tenants of DevSecOps. Discussing 

Theme of The Good, The bad, The Ugly...

__History_of_DevSecOps__

  The Ops
    History of how we got here... from a computer running in a controled enviornment 
    Rainbow of machines
    Scale, yea it's a big issue!

  The Sec
    Started just as access to the machine, avilablity of resources
    Scanning source code
    images... scanning 
  
  The Dev
    Build it and they will come. or something like that... build it and they will Deploy Deploy Deploy !

_DevSecOps_Tenets_

I. Automation. Automate! Automate! Automate! *Dev* *Ops* *Sec*
  choose one or two or more, and use it!
    using an automation tool to just call bash script is not automation 
  idempotent 

Pipelines, CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment) *Dev* *Sec* *Ops*
  At the heart of DevSecOps

II. We don't test were professional!
  Professional do test, and test and test.
  Plan for failure and plan to fail
    This is part of what CI/CD is about, the ability to fail and handle it
      Alert!!!!
      Roll back ?
  Planing to fail forward is a plan 
    maybe not great but it is a plan
    can be done if planned for
  Not all sistuations are testable.
    There limits to resources
    There are limits to costs
    Do what you can, and prepare for failure
  Build a test library, take fails and 

III. Secrets should be Secret! *Sec*
  Secrets should never be hard coded! 
  Env vars are good
  Cli options work, but may be exposed ( could happen in logging tools, monitoring tools)

O1TZ - There is only ONE timezone! 20240307T000000Z (okay two Moon time is a thing! ) *Ops*
  alias timestamp="date -u +"%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ"" 

Log, Log, LOG more! (alright so you can log too much, try to reach a happy medium) *Ops* *Dev*

Name things....  *Ops*
  be sure monitoring put a unique name on the alert
  it is nice to make things that can be talked about... but that is a left over from days of herding... but still nice :|

_Tips_
Copy and Paste
  I know this applies a lot to the cli, but copy and paste... Type-O's can be very bad...

API's are great
  creating and 

Security Scanning *Sec*
  Need to scan before deployment....
    scan code
    scan images
    scan all!
  Done as part of the pipelines...
  Leverage prebuild tools, github
  ? fixx images/known issues....  ? 

_Development Tips_
  Always make options Command Line options *Dev*
    When automating it is difficult to fill out forms/answer questions.
  Check input values
  Always return a status
