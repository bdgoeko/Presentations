This is a collection of useful CLI command/command options I have found. Most the tools have been tested on GNU Linux, often Ubuntu, so your millage may vary other places.

I forget some of these because I don't use them all the time but they are *VERY* useful! So I thought I would put them somewhere I _might_ be able to find them....


PS (Linux ps)
  Tool to see processes and childen visually on the CLI (yes it is the --forest through the trees )
  $ ps -eaf --forest

Date the magical elixir of time! (Full GNU Date on Linux)
  be sure you are using a real GNU version of date or some things will not work!

  Getting the only time there is UTC
  $ date -u



GNU read has a timeout option ( -t {seconds to wait} )

  $ read -t 5 IgnoreThisVariable
