          What is Git ? <BR>
          <BR>
          Git is a distributed Revision Control System<BR>
          <BR>
          A great tool for modern distributed teams working on projects.<BR>

<section>
          Where is Git from ? <BR>
          <BR>
          Git was developed by <A Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds"> Linux Torvalds</A> in 2005 after many developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to <A Href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper">BitKeeper</A>.<BR>

<section>
          Why use Git ? <BR>
          <BR>
          Git is Open Source ( <A Href="https://github.com/git/git"> Git's Git Repo </A> )<BR>
          Available client/server on Linux <BR>
          Easy to use once started<BR>
          GitHub<BR>
          Available client for several platforms (I believe servers are also available.)<BR>
          Used by a lot of opensource projects<BR>
          <BR>

          <BR>
          Work Code Development <BR>
          Work Repo's for Puppet, Ansible and other tools.<BR>
          Personal project, <A Href="https://github.com/bdgoeko"> https://github.com/bdgoeko</A><BR>

          Clone<BR>
          (Copy code local)<BR>
          <BR>
          <pre><code>
$ git clone https://github.com/bdgoeko/Presentations.git 
          </code></pre><BR>
          You can use a https or an ssh url to clone the code, you usually get this by going to repo.<BR>
          <BR>Slide 23
          <aside class="notes">
            I don't believe you can copy part of a repo.<BR>
            Not sure that would be a good idea even if you could<BR>
            Should add screen shot that shows where they are in the UI...<BR>
            Not as easy to find for hardcore CLI'r<BR>
            but.. <BR>
            For a local project, on the same machine and you have access to read (and write ?)<BR>
            $ git clone  /srv/home/goeko/Projects/Git/experments/<BR>
            Again for a "local" machine that you have ssh access to <BR>
            $ git clone gituser@example.com:/opt/jupiter.git jupiter.clone<BR>
          </aside>
        </section>

<section>
          Branch<BR>
          <BR>
          <pre><code>
$ git checkout -b how_i_get
          </code></pre><BR>
          This will create a branch and check it out.<BR>
          <BR>
          All work you do from now on will be on this branch.<BR>
          <BR>Slide 22
          <aside class="notes">
            I have run into some big probems with branch names and plugins/intergrations. <BR>
            Be sure you understand any intergrations used in your systems!<BR>

<section>
          Digressions on branching/branches<BR>
          <BR>
          You may want to designate "special" branchs for important purposes. <BR>
          ie. The Master branch is always the current production code.<BR>
             and the "dev" branch is always the pre-Production code... <BR>
          You can enfore this multiple ways, and depends on the server you are using.<BR>
          <BR>
          see <A Href="https://git-scm.com/about"> https://git-scm.com/about </A><BR>
          <BR>
          <BR>Slide 21
          <aside class="notes">
            This can be very useful.<BR>
            If this is done it should also be well publisied.<BR>
          </aside>
        </section>

<section>
          More work with Branch<BR>
          <BR>
          We can switch to a different branch.<BR>
          <pre><code>
$ git checkout master
M	How_I_Git/how_i_git.html
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
$ git branch
  AnotherBranchToShowMultipleBranchs
  how_i_get
* master
          </code></pre><BR>
          In this case we just switched back to the master branch... we could switch to any branch.<BR>
          Rember though you are working on that branch then any changes your add and commit will be on that branch!<BR>
          <BR>Slide 22
          <aside class="notes">
            You can always use 'git status' to see what branch you are are<BR>
            There are also ways to have your branch displayed on the prompt<BR>

          Code Magic!<BR>
          <BR>
          Now you are ready to edit your code, make the magic changes that will make the World Better....<BR>
          or at least your code base<BR>
          <BR>
          So make your changes, edit with your favorite editor.<BR>

            I use often use 'vi' sometimes even 'emacs' but I don't often use and editor that is Git aware...<BR>

<section>
          Look Git noticed your changes<BR>
          <BR>
          <pre><code>
$ git status
On branch how_i_get
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   how_i_git.html

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	How_I_Git_Workflow.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

          </code></pre><BR>
          We have two files here that Git noticed changed.  On tracked, ie we already have in our repo and one not.<BR>

          Commit Changes<BR>
          <BR>
          These changes look good, the code is functioning we are ready to commit this code.<BR>
          <pre><code>
$ git commit -m "Added graphic of how I Git and added more slides"

          <BR> 
          At this point you can continue to work and commit changes as long a you like.<BR> 
          But all changes on *ONLY* being local stored, nothing has been "pushed" to the server.<BR> 
          So changes could be lost if you lose your hard drive.<BR>
          <BR>Slide 17
          <aside class="notes">
            How many changes, how much to push are often a personal decision.<BR>
            but I would argue for commit and push often!<BR>

        </section>

 <section>
          Ready to Push<BR>
          <BR>
          We have made great progress, we have code that is working.<BR>
          We may want to add more features, or refine some parts, but we can do that later we want to make the code availbe for others to look at.<BR>
          So it is time to push the code.<BR>
          This will put the code in the branch on the server.<BR>

          Ignore some files<BR>
          <BR>
          More than likely not every file you have in the directory is something you want to track, or checkin<BR>
          You can use a .gitignore to tell git what files/directories you don't want to track<BR>
          Here is the .gitignore file I am using, this one is located in the base directory of the repo.<BR>
          You may want/need to exclude files directorys that other intergrations may generate or are are temp files.<BR>
          Or you may want to ignore files that may have credentials.<BR>

          How to Undo a commit<BR>
          <BR>
          If you want to undo, remove, take away the last commit<BR>
          What you are doing in Git is moving the HEAD pointer backwards X links back.<BR>
          ie. undo the changes that are in the what HEAD currently points to<BR>
          <BR>
          This can be *VERY* messy, handle with great care... you may way to archive the the whole hierarchy<BR>
