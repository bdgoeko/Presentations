	  March Bashness<BR>
	  Getting started with Bash Programming<BR>
	  We will cover the basics for Bash shell programming so you can start programming shell scripts.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Shell and scripting language<BR>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Bash History..<BR>
	  <BR>	  
	  Not as old as me! First release 1989<BR>
	  Still being maintained, updated, and extened!<BR>
	  Mostly bash is stable, has core that has been the same since 1991<BR>
	  example '~='<BR>

	  Why Learn ? shell scripting ?<BR>
	</section>

	<section>
	  <LI>Used *ALOT* ! Every Linux system has bash. <BR>
          (or some sort of shell)<BR>
	  <LI>Used for Startup Scripts<BR>
	  <LI>Used for Installation Scripts<BR>
	  <LI>Used for Process/System Monitoring<BR>
	  <LI>Used for CI <BR>
	  <LI> and....<BR>
	</section>

          I love bash because<BR>
	  <BR>
	  <LI> Quick to get going<BR>
	    can get something working in short time<BR>
	  <LI> Able to take what I was doing on CLI<BR>
	    and put it in a script<BR>
	  <LI> Any CLI command can be used in a script!<BR>
	  <LI> Reliable!<BR>
	  <LI> Great GLUE between this and that...<BR>
	    Systems super glue!<BR>
	  <LI> Easy to experment and try<BR>

	<section>
	  What Bash doesn't work for.... <BR>
	  Although I love working with Bash,<BR>
	  it doesn't hammer all nails!<BR>
	  <LI>It does not work well for work in databases<BR>
	  <LI>It does not work well for heavy computing tasks<BR>
	    (of course)<BR>
	  <LI>Math is not shell's strong point.<BR>
	  <LI> Hard to intergrate several systems and string output/input together<LI>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    Off the top of my head I don't think there is an easy way to do floating point.<BR>
	    Other than "Just DO NOT do that!"<BR>
	  </aside>
	</section>

	<section>
	  CLI Bash<BR>
          <BR>
	  Starting with the CLI, I often use the CLI to work out what I want to do in a script<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Use ';' to put several commands on the same line.<BR>
	  while has a little different format<BR>
          <pre><code>
while true; do clear; uptime; ls -lrt; read -t 10 ANS ;done
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
	    Often work in the CLI to build up what I want.<BR>
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
	  CLI processes pid finder<BR>
          <BR>
          <pre><code>
ps -eaf | grep xterm | grep -v grep | while read OWN PID STUFF; do echo $PID; done
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
	  CLI log colorize.<BR>
	  <BR>
	  <pre><code>
tail -f mail.log | awk '
/reachlocal/ {print "\033[33m" $0 "\033[39m" }
/reject/ {print "\033[31m" $0 "\033[39m" }
/convertcontacts/ {print "\033[32m" $0 "\033[39m"} // {print $0 }
'
	  </code></pre><BR>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    I sometimes run a 'tail -f' and put it in the background so I can still work on the terminal or I can do a 'date' to add to the log output.<BR>
	</section>

	<section>
	  Moving it to a file!<BR>
	  Once you have a few commands you are going to use you can put them into a file.<BR>
	  You will also want to make the file executable with chmod +x [FILENAME]<BR>
	</section>
	
	<section>
	  Simple Script!<BR>
          <BR>
	  put the folling code into a file example1.sh<BR>
	  And then be sure to make it executable with chmod<BR>
	  and run the script with ./example1.sh<BR>
          <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash

# This is a simple example script.

echo "Hello You!"

exit 0
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
'#!/bin/bash' is special Un*x magic! This will cause the system to execute "/bin/bash" when the script is marked executable and run.<BR>
'#' is a comment, when a bare # appears on a line anything after it will be ignored! <BR>             
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
          Another simple script with input<BR>
          <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash

#Another simple script

echo "Hello."
echo "The NSA would like to know your name. "
echo "Would you please tell me ?"
read ANAME

echo "Thank you ${ANAME}"
exit 0
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
There are a number of predefined variables.
A better way to call bash is the use of "env bash"
ie the first line of your script would be 
#!/usr/bin/env bash 
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
	  VARIABLES!<BR>
	  <LI>Bash has variables
	  <LI>There are local and global
	  <LI>There are several variables that are pre-defined
	  <LI>There are variables that some programs use, if defined!
	</section>
	
	<section>
          Programming is the process of doing a little processing...<BR>
	  And doing A LOT of input checking!<BR>
          <pre><code>
#!/bin/bash

#Another simple script

echo "Hello."
echo "The NSA would like to know your name. "

while test -z "${ANAME}"
do
  echo "Would you please tell me ?"
  read ANAME
done

echo "Thank you ${ANAME}"
exit 0

	<section>
	  Redirection!<BR>
	  <LI>Stdin is the default input (keyboard)<BR>
	  <LI>Stdout is where the standard output will go (terminal)<BR>
	  <LI>Stderr is where the output for the errors (terminal)<BR>
	  <LI>File descriptiors 0 - stdin , 1 - stdout, 3 - stderr <BR>
	  > >> 2> 2>> <BR>
	  <pre><code>
 command > stdout_goes_here.test 2> stderr_out_goes_here.text
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
	    Bash manual on redirection
	    http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-3.html
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
          <LI>You can have other input/output streams...<BR>
	  <LI>Both of the output streams goto the screen <BR>
	  hard to tell apart.<BR>
	  (Some programs use stderr to send messages/prompts)<BR>
          <pre><code>
ssh www.goecke-dolan.com "ps -eaf" > atemp.log
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
	    Great example, where did the output go ? <BR>
	    But it didn't go ?<BR>
	    So ... stdout went to the file (via the '>')<BR>
	    but the stderr goes to the screen...<BR>
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
          Another Example<BR>
	  Send stdout and stderr to log file<BR>
          <pre><code>
tar -cvf A_Backup_File.tar.gz 2>&1 > A_Backup_File.log
          </code></pre><br>
          <br>
          <aside class="notes">
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
          Pipes!<BR> 
	  Another form for redirection<BR>
	  Sends output from one process to the input of another process<BR>
          <pre><code>
ps -eaf | grep grep | cut -d\  -f1 | more
          </code></pre><br>
          <aside class="notes">
	    Can you send only stderr to another process ? <BR>
	    hummm.... <BR>
          </aside>
        </section>

	<section>
          Cutting and reformating<BR>
	  Often need to reformat input<BR>
	  You can use Un*x tools<BR>
          <pre><code>
          </code></pre><br>

	  clean exit<BR>
	  <BR>
	  Know what your exit code will be.<BR>
	  In bash (Un*x Shell) 0 == Good exit<BR>
	  and <> 0 bad...<BR>

	<section>
	  Know your exit code<BR>
	  <BR>
	  You can use the exit from a command you run, or set and give your own.<BR>
	  But give an exit code, and be sure you understand what it will be!<BR>

	  Debugging Bash<BR>
	  <BR>
	  echo/print/output<BR>
	  can also use logger to output to system logs<BR>
	  set -v and '#!/bin/bash -v'<BR>
	  <aside class="notes">
	    You can define a variable with the number of the file handle of where the debug output should go.<BR>
	    Then of course you can redirect that file handle to a file.<BR>

	  MUST RUN PEFECT!<BR>
	  <BR>
	  You can do a 'set -e' which will enable a mode that every command MUST execute successfully, or the script will exit.<BR>
	  Usually the shell does not check or require every command to be successful, it leave that upto you !<BR>
