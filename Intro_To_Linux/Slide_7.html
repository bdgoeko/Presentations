Unix is still a "factured" OS today.
</H1>
<H3>
With the odd "childhood" of Unix, several Unix arose.  There are several large computer compaines with "there" Unix today, Sun, HP, and IBM.  During the 80's they attempted to form standards, ie POSIX, SVID, and others to make it easier to make software for Unix that will run on more than one system.  This was not successful, but they still try today.  There is even talk of "binary-compatiblity" today.  We will have to see if this happens.
