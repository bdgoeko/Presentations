Linux Distributions
</H1>
<H3>
The Kernel is "bundled" with other tools to make a distribution.  Some of these distributions are free, or part of them is free.  Some are "bundled" with there own tools/programs.  Not all is freely available.  This is simular but different from Unix Version because they all use the same kernel, but have different tools with them. <BR>
<BR>
Some distributions are for specific CPU, or Hardware.  Where as some run on several Hardware platforms.  Most run on some form of PC hardware.<BR>
<BR>
Distributions are made for different reasons.  Some are based on other version with added security.  Some are more general.  Distribtuions can, and are, made for any reason under the sun.
